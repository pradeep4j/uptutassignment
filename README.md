# React Native Firebase sign-up/sign-in/logout

This is a React Native Firebase Starter Project with login, registration, persisted login.

This React Native Firebase starter contains a few key features that all apps backed by Fireabase support:

* Registration with E-mail & Password
* Login with E-mail and Password
* Handling persisted login credentials
* Navigation (react-native-navigation. All three navigations are implemented.)
* Writing to Firestore Database
* Reading from Firestore Database
* Creating Firestore indices (for performance)

 ## Getting Started (with react-native-cli)

```
git clone https://github.com/pradeep4j/uptutassignment.git
cd uptutassignment

npm install
react-native run-android 
```
## I do not have Google Play Developer account. You must have to see it on AVD. Android vitual devices have two options either use an emulator or use physical device connected via usb in laptop. 
This React Native Firebase starter is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with React Native CLI.
